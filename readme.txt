Plugin to allow easy importing of atom feeds to blog.

== Description ==

This was ripped beautifully from the standard [Wordpress RSS importer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rss-importer/). A lot of the functionality was taken from there and tweaked so it could handle atom feeds so credit to them.

Everything else was done by [Piers Karsenbarg](http://piersonthe.net).
